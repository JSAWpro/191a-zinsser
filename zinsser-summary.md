# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Jan Sawyer

Zinsser states that communication should be as direct as possible. It is common for everyone to use more words than necessary while writing or talking. The use for unnecessary words and phrases should be disregarded so that the other person will understand with ease. Repetitive adverbs and adjectives are also unnecessary. If the verb or noun is sufficient, there is no need for adverbs and adjectives. Complicated words may sound better but simple words are just as effective while retaining its meaning. Short and simple is the key to good writing.
